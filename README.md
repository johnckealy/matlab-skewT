# Matlab-SkewT

Matlab code for generating a skewT-logP diagram, which is used to visualize atmospheric vertical profiles of temperature and dew point. 


### Description

This is an older code that I dug up from my UH days.. I don't really code in Matlab anymore but hopefully it can provide a good starting point if you want to try to adapt this to your own work. It works on the principle of iterating the thermodynamic equations upward, but there are more elegant ways to do this. See tephigrams.org for my later work in skewT visualization.
